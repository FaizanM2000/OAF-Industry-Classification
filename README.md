# OAF-Industry-Classification
This github repository serves as a report for the Open Avenues Foundation Industry Classification micro internship. It shows our team's work on a NLP project, namely: classifying 20,000 companies into their industries (out of 13) based on their descriptions. 

Here you can find the documentation on the different stages of the project such as the data cleaning stage, applying different vectorization techniques, and then implementing versions of basic topic and unsupervised sentence classification.
